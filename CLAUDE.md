# AnythingLLM B2B E-commerce Chat Solution - Claude Code Configuration

## ü§ñ Sub-Agent Development Workflow

This project uses three specialized Claude Code sub-agents for enhanced development:

1. **Planner Agent** (`@planner`) - Technical architecture and planning
2. **Coder Agent** (`@coder`) - TDD implementation and coding
3. **Tester Agent** (`@tester`) - Quality assurance and testing

Use `/dev-cycle [feature]` for complete plan‚Üícode‚Üítest workflow.

## Core Principles
Follow TDD approach. Build and verify results yourself first before asking me to check myself. Try making the code modular so we can reuse if possible.


## Documentation Update Checklist

When completing features or making significant changes, ALWAYS update:
- **CURRENT_STATE.md** - Update ONLY when features are production-ready
- **CODE_INDEX.md** - Add new functions, classes, or modules
- **Architecture docs** - Update for design changes
- **WORKING_JOURNAL.md** - Note development progress (not implementation details)

### Documentation Maintenance Tools
- Run `python scripts/verify_documentation.py` to check consistency
- Git hook installed: `.githooks/pre-commit-docs` (reminds about doc updates)
- CI/CD check: `.github/workflows/doc-consistency-check.yml`

## Development Guidelines

### üõë IMPORTANT: Stage Gate Process
**STOP AND WAIT FOR APPROVAL AFTER EACH STAGE**

When completing any stage (e.g., v0.1_s1.1, v0.1_s1.2, etc.):
1. Run `/testgo` to validate all tests for that stage
2. Update STAGE_PROGRESS.md with completion status using `/devgo`
3. Run `/stage-complete` to mark stage done and update shared roadmap
4. **STOP and inform the user that the stage is complete**
5. **WAIT for explicit approval before proceeding to the next stage**

Example completion workflow:
```bash
/testgo                              # Validate all tests pass
/devgo                               # Update branch progress
/stage-complete                      # Mark stage complete
# ‚úÖ Stage v0p1.p1.s1 Complete! Awaiting approval to proceed to s2
```

### üéØ Feature Development Process
**MANDATORY PROCESS FOR ALL NEW FEATURES**

**Context is King** - Always understand the full context before starting.

#### 1. Research Phase
- **Multiple Solutions**: Research at least 2-3 potential approaches
- **Resource Utilization**: Use knowledge base, internet resources, MCPs, existing codebase
- **Document Options**: Create brief comparison of approaches

#### 2. Analysis & Architecture Consultation
- **Architecture Alignment**: Consult current & planned architecture documents
- **Best Fit Analysis**: Choose solution that best fits system design
- **Technical Debt**: Consider long-term maintainability and scalability

#### 3. Test-Drive Implementation
- **Skeleton Code**: Build basic structure first to validate approach
- **Early Validation**: Ensure core concepts work before full implementation
- **Rapid Iteration**: Fail fast if approach doesn't work

#### 4. Full Implementation
- **Descriptive comments**: add descriptive comment blocks to main /key functions.
- **Modular Design**: Keep files under 1500 lines.
- **No Duplication**: Check for existing similar files/functions before creating new ones
- **Clean Architecture**: Split large files into smaller, focused modules

#### 5. Testing & Documentation
- **Branch Testing**: Use `/testgo` for branch-specific test validation
- **Progress Tracking**: Use `/devgo` to update STAGE_PROGRESS.md
- **Regular Checkpoints**: Use `/checkpoint` for progress saves
- **Stage Completion**: Use `/stage-complete` when stage is done

#### 6. Test Plan Execution
```bash
# Development workflow with new command system
/workhere                    # Get current context and guidance
/devgo                       # Check development status, create test plans
/testgo                      # Execute tests and update branch progress
/checkpoint "Feature X done" # Save progress with descriptive message
/stage-complete              # Mark stage complete when ready
```

#### Code Quality Rules
- **No Duplication**: Never create duplicate files, functions, or similar content
- **File Size Limits**: Keep files under 1000-1500 lines
- **Modular Design**: Split large files into focused, reusable modules
- **Existing Code First**: Always check if functionality already exists before building new

- **Cross-Branch Visibility**: STAGE_STATUS.md shows test status across all branches

### Test Plan Workflow
```bash
# New enhanced workflow
/workhere                    # Get current context
/devgo                       # Check development status, create test plans if needed
/testgo                      # Execute tests specific to current branch/stage
/checkpoint "Tests passing"  # Save progress with test results
/stage-complete              # Mark stage complete when all tests pass
```

### Prototype Validation
- **SOP Matching Tests**: Verify correct SOP identification for various tasks
- **LangGraph Workflows**: Test state management and node execution
- **Content Generation**: Validate real content creation pipelines
- **Performance**: <2 seconds for workflow orchestration

### Example Test Scenarios
