## 🎯 Success Metrics Tracking

### Week 1 Target Metrics
- **Companies to Monitor**: 0 / 10-15
- **Scraping Service**: Not started / Complete
- **API Endpoints**: 0 / 4 core endpoints
- **UI Pages**: 0 / 2 main pages

### Overall MVP Progress
- **Week 1 Progress**: 0% complete (0/7 major tasks)
- **Timeline**: On schedule - planning phase complete
- **Quality**: Documentation-first approach established

---

## 🚀 Key Architectural Decisions

### MVP Approach Benefits
- ✅ **Incremental Value**: Each week delivers working features
- ✅ **Simple Architecture**: FastAPI + Next.js for rapid development
- ✅ **Automation First**: N8N for workflow automation from day one

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **✅ FastAPI**: Fast development, automatic API docs, type safety
- **✅ Next.js**: Full-stack capabilities, great DX, production-ready
- **✅ N8N**: Visual workflows, easy integration, self-hosted

## 📈 Performance & Quality

### Target Metrics
- **Time Savings**: Target 85%+ reduction
- **Coverage**: Target 30+ companies (vs 10-15 manual)
- **Discovery Rate**: Target 5+ new companies/week
- **System Uptime**: Target 95%+

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80%+ for backend
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated with FastAPI
- **Code Review**: All PRs reviewed
- **Performance**: <2s page loads

---

## 🔍 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Web Scraping Blocks**: Plan for rate limiting and user agent rotation
- **LinkedIn Limits**: Design with caching and batch processing
- **Scope Creep**: Strict weekly goals to maintain focus

### Mitigation Strategies
- ✅ **Simple First**: Start with basic features, iterate
- ✅ **Fallback Options**: Manual entry for blocked scraping
- ✅ **Cost Controls**: API usage caps for AI services
