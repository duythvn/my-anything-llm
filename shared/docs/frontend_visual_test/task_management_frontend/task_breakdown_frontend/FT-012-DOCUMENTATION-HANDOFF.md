# FT-012: Documentation & Handoff

**Estimate**: 4 hours  
**Priority**: P1 High - Production Feature  
**Dependencies**: All features (FT-001 to FT-011)  
**Phase**: Production Enhancement (Delayed)

---

## Overview

**⚠️ PRODUCTION FEATURE - DELAYED FOR LATER IMPLEMENTATION**

This feature focuses on comprehensive documentation and team handoff preparation. While documentation should be created incrementally during development, this task covers the final documentation package and formal handoff process.

## Objectives

- Create comprehensive setup and usage documentation
- Document all testing procedures and features
- Prepare handoff materials for team adoption
- Record demonstration videos and guides

---

## Detailed Tasks

### Task 12.1: Setup Documentation (1 hour)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md (30 min)
- [ ] Document environment setup steps (15 min)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide (15 min)

### Task 12.2: Feature Documentation (1.5 hours)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Document authentication and navigation (20 min)
- [ ] Document chat testing procedures (20 min)
- [ ] Document upload and knowledge browser (20 min)
- [ ] Document admin tools usage (20 min)
- [ ] Create API testing guide (10 min)

### Task 12.3: Development Guide (1 hour)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Document component development patterns (30 min)
- [ ] Add code style conventions (15 min)
- [ ] Create new feature template (15 min)

### Task 12.4: Handoff Preparation (0.5 hours)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create handoff checklist (15 min)
- [ ] Package demo credentials (5 min)
- [ ] Create quick start guide (10 min)

## When to Implement

### Prerequisites
- Core functionality (FT-001 to FT-007) complete and stable
- All major features tested and working
- Ready for team adoption and wider usage
- Development patterns established

### Documentation Approach
- **Incremental**: Create basic docs during development
- **Comprehensive**: Full documentation package at completion
- **User-Focused**: Write for developers who will use the testing interface

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete setup instructions available
- [ ] All features documented with examples
- [ ] Team can use interface independently
- [ ] Development patterns clearly explained
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide addresses common issues
- [ ] Handoff materials ready for team adoption

---

## Implementation Notes

### Why This is Delayed
1. **Incremental Approach**: Basic documentation should be written during development
2. **Usage Patterns**: Best documentation comes from actual usage experience
3. **Complete Picture**: Final documentation requires all features to be implemented
4. **Team Ready**: Comprehensive handoff when interface is proven and stable

### Documentation Strategy

#### During Development (FT-001 to FT-007)
- Write basic README for each feature
- Document API endpoints as they're tested
- Keep notes on setup and configuration
- Record issues and solutions

#### At Completion (FT-012)
- Consolidate all documentation
- Create comprehensive guides
- Record demonstration videos
- Prepare formal handoff materials
