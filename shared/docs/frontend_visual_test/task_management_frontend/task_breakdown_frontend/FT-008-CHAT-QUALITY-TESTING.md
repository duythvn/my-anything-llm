# FT-008: Chat Quality Testing

**Estimate**: 6 hours  
**Priority**: P1 High - Production Feature  
**Dependencies**: FT-004  
**Phase**: Production Enhancement (Delayed)

---

## Overview

**⚠️ PRODUCTION FEATURE - DELAYED FOR LATER IMPLEMENTATION**

This feature adds advanced chat quality testing capabilities including multi-model comparison, batch testing, and quality analysis. This is not needed for core internal testing and should be implemented after the core functionality (FT-001 to FT-007) is complete and proven.

## Objectives

- Test chat quality across multiple models
- Enable batch testing with CSV uploads
- Compare responses between different models
- Analyze and score response quality

---

## Detailed Tasks

### Task 8.1: Test Query Interface (1.5 hours)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create ChatQualityTest page component (30 min)
- [ ] Design test query input form (30 min)
- [ ] Add test parameters section (20 min)
- [ ] Create query history sidebar (10 min)

### Task 8.2: Batch Testing Features (2 hours)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create batch test upload component (45 min)
- [ ] Design CSV template for batch tests (30 min)
- [ ] Implement file parser for test data (30 min)
- [ ] Create batch progress tracker (15 min)

### Task 8.3: Multi-Model Comparison (1.5 hours)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create model selection interface (30 min)
- [ ] Design comparison results table (30 min)
- [ ] Implement parallel query execution (20 min)
- [ ] Add response time tracking (10 min)

### Task 8.4: Quality Analysis & Export (1 hour)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create quality score display (30 min)
- [ ] Add response analysis breakdown (15 min)
- [ ] Implement test history viewer (10 min)
- [ ] Create export functionality (5 min)

## When to Implement

### Prerequisites
- Core testing interface (FT-001 to FT-007) complete and stable
- Backend quality testing APIs developed
- Multi-model support implemented in backend
- Quality scoring system in place

### Implementation Trigger
- When advanced quality assurance is needed
- When comparing multiple LLM models
- When batch testing capabilities required
- When quality metrics become important

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can test single queries across multiple models
- [ ] Batch testing works with CSV uploads
- [ ] Model comparison displays side-by-side results
- [ ] Quality metrics are calculated and displayed
- [ ] Test results can be exported
- [ ] Test history is maintained

---

## API Requirements

### Required Backend APIs
```
POST /api/v1/admin/chat/test - Single query test
POST /api/v1/admin/chat/batch-test - Batch query testing
GET /api/v1/admin/chat/models - Available models
GET /api/v1/admin/chat/quality-score - Quality analysis
GET /api/v1/admin/chat/test-history - Test history
```

---

## Implementation Notes

### Why This is Delayed
1. **Not Core to Testing**: Basic chat testing (FT-004) covers essential functionality
2. **Complex Backend Dependency**: Requires advanced quality scoring systems
3. **Resource Intensive**: Multi-model comparison requires significant backend resources
4. **Nice-to-Have**: Quality testing is useful but not critical for API validation

### Implementation Approach When Ready
- Build on existing chat interface (FT-004)
- Add quality testing as separate tab/section
- Reuse existing chat components where possible
- Focus on batch testing and comparison features

---

## Deliverables (When Implemented)

1. **Quality Testing Interface**
   - Single and batch query testing
   - Multi-model selection
   - Quality parameter configuration

2. **Comparison Tools**
   - Side-by-side response comparison
   - Quality score visualization
   - Performance metrics display

3. **Analysis & Export**
   - Test history management
   - Results export functionality
   - Quality trend analysis

---

## Next Steps

**Current Priority**: Skip this task and move to core functionality completion
**Future Implementation**: After FT-001 to FT-007 are complete and requirements are clear
**Dependencies**: Backend quality testing APIs must be developed first

---

## Notes

- This is a production enhancement, not core testing functionality
- Should be implemented only after core testing is proven and stable
- Requires significant backend development for quality scoring
- Focus on core API testing first (FT-001 to FT-007)
