# FT-011: Performance Optimization

**Estimate**: 6 hours  
**Priority**: P1 High - Production Feature  
**Dependencies**: All features (FT-001 to FT-010)  
**Phase**: Production Enhancement (Delayed)

---

## Overview

**⚠️ PRODUCTION FEATURE - DELAYED FOR LATER IMPLEMENTATION**

This feature focuses on performance optimization including code splitting, caching, and rendering optimizations. While important for production quality, this should only be implemented after core functionality is complete and performance bottlenecks are identified through actual usage.

## Objectives

- Optimize application load times and bundle size
- Improve rendering performance for large datasets
- Implement caching strategies for API responses
- Add performance monitoring and optimization

---

- [ ] Add loading components for lazy-loaded routes (30 min)
- [ ] Optimize component imports and dependencies (30 min)
- [ ] Bundle analysis and size optimization (15 min)

### Task 11.2: Rendering Optimization (2 hours)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists (45 min)
- [ ] Add React.memo for expensive components (30 min)

### Task 11.3: API & Caching Optimization (1.5 hours)

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Implement API response caching (30 min)
- [ ] Add request deduplication (20 min)

## When to Implement

### Prerequisites
- Core functionality (FT-001 to FT-007) complete and stable
- Real usage data available to identify bottlenecks
- Performance issues identified through testing
- User feedback about slow operations

### Performance Targets
- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- Route transitions: < 500ms
- Search results: < 300ms
- Large list scrolling: 60fps
- Bundle size: < 1MB gzipped

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Page load times under 2 seconds
- [ ] Smooth scrolling in large lists
- [ ] No UI freezing during operations
- [ ] Reduced bundle size by 30%+
- [ ] Improved search response times
- [ ] Efficient memory usage

---

## Implementation Notes

### Why This is Delayed
1. **Premature Optimization**: Optimize after identifying real bottlenecks
2. **Usage Patterns**: Performance issues become clear through real usage
3. **Feature Complete**: Core functionality must work before optimizing
4. **Measurement First**: Need baseline performance data before optimization

### Optimization Strategies

#### Bundle Optimization
```javascript
// Route-based code splitting
const ChatTest = lazy(() => import('./pages/ChatTest/ChatTest'));
const DocumentUpload = lazy(() => import('./pages/DocumentUpload/DocumentUpload'));
const KnowledgeBrowser = lazy(() => import('./pages/KnowledgeBrowser/KnowledgeBrowser'));

// Component lazy loading
const AdminPanel = lazy(() => import('./pages/AdminPanel/AdminPanel'));
```

#### Virtual Scrolling
```javascript
// For large document lists
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const DocumentList = ({ documents }) => (
  <List
    height={600}
    itemCount={documents.length}
    itemSize={120}
    itemData={documents}
  >
    {DocumentRow}
  </List>
);
```

#### API Caching
```javascript
// Simple in-memory cache
const apiCache = new Map();

const cachedFetch = async (url, options = {}) => {
  const cacheKey = `${url}-${JSON.stringify(options)}`;
  const cached = apiCache.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < 300000) { // 5 min cache
    return cached.data;
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  const data = await response.json();
  
  apiCache.set(cacheKey, {
    data,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  
  return data;
};
```

## Next Steps

**Current Priority**: Focus on core functionality (FT-001 to FT-007) first
**Future Implementation**: After core features are stable and performance issues identified
**Approach**: Measure first, optimize second

## Notes

- Performance optimization without measurement is premature
- Core functionality must be complete before optimizing
- Real usage patterns reveal true bottlenecks
- Focus on user-perceived performance improvements
- Avoid over-optimization that adds complexity without benefit
