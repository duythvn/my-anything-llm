## Technical Approach

### Reuse Strategy
**Maximize use of AnythingLLM components:**
- ✅ Authentication system (add JWT)
- ✅ Workspace model (add e-commerce fields)
- ✅ Document processing (add product imports)
- ✅ Vector search (optimize for products)
- ✅ Chat infrastructure (focus on knowledge)
- ✅ Embed widget (simplify for e-commerce)
- ✅ Admin UI (extend for e-commerce)

### New Development
**E-commerce specific features:**
- 🆕 Product catalog management
- 🆕 Order/customer integrations
- 🆕 E-commerce platform connectors
- 🆕 Shopping assistance features
- 🆕 Multi-tenant billing
- 🆕 Self-service portal

### Integration Points
**Key areas for platform connections:**
- `server/endpoints/` - Add e-commerce endpoints
- `server/models/` - Extend models for e-commerce
- `collector/` - Add product import processors
- `utils/agents/` - Future: order processing agents
- `embed/` - Customize for product queries

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Vector Search Performance**
   - Mitigation: Start with smaller catalogs, implement caching
   
2. **Multi-Tenant Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Single-tenant first, gradual migration

3. **E-commerce API Variations**
   - Mitigation: Start with Shopify, abstract common interface

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP focus on knowledge queries
   
2. **Integration Delays**
   - Mitigation: Mock APIs for parallel development
