> follow test plan here '/home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/docs/TEST_PLAN.md' 
  and write a report summary and save to .. If there are action points bout failed 
  tests, please clearly outline so we can share with our developer LLM 
  '/home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/tester_reports'  NOTE:
  Python & libs are all installed.  we have already got 
  python main.py running in another terminal in sleep mode so you don't need to run it whenever its mentioned, 
  also don't kill the the process as we want to keep it running so you can test




  │ > we are building a agentic system, we have built codes and will be going through stagging tests / test       │
│   plans. see the test plans here. go through each plan and follow the test mention in each plan to run        │
│   your own test. '/home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/test_plans/plans'  , then  produce reports        │
│   under '/home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/test_plans/reports/gemini_reports' for each test plan      │
│   (e.g: v0.1_s1.1_test_report.md  ..)  so we can share to the coding llm 

follow the test plan here 
 '/home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/test_plans/plans/v0.1_s1.1_exter
  nal_test_plan.md' start that test plan again and report under '/home/duyth/
  codingprojects/agentic_system/test_plans/reports/gemini_reports' . remember
   our python and all required depencies are in our virtualenv and can be 
  activated by runnin source backend/venv/bin/activate  . only report on 
  tests, if a test fail, try it again a 2nd time , and attempt up to 3 times,
   then move to the next step  (anticipate edge cases like timeout ..). don't
   fix codes, the goal is to follow the test as blackbox testing

> as our codebase is expanding, we need to have a document for our developers/coding LLMs to use as references to know the main code files , main functions, what they are for and where they are saved in, please build a file for this and save in docs. 



 to see if we have files that are no longer need or if we have dulpicate files , if so please clean up   


activate virtual env source backend/venv/bin/activate
 go through each plan and follow the test mention in each plan to run 
your own test. '/home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/test_plans/plans'  , then  produce reports  under '/home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/test_plans/reports/gemini_reports' for each test plan  similar to this report format /home/duyth/codingprojects/agentic_system/test_plans/reports/2nd_run/by_gemini/v0.1_s1.2_report.md 
Do not atttempt to fix anything, we are only testing & reporting
NOTE: the backend can be start from virtual environment


let's continue, starting from test_plans/plans/v0.1_s2.1_external_test_plan.md


 activate virtual env source backend/venv/bin/activate . go through the failed tests mentioned here, the            │
│   python api can be started from backend/ (in virtual environment) ... update the report withfinding

# From README.md
  Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.10+
  - Node.js 18+
  - PostgreSQL 14+  # <- This is expected but not provided
  - OpenAI API key

  # From BACKEND_SPECIFIC.md
  Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.10+
  - PostgreSQL 14+  # <- Again, expected but not set up
  - Redis 6+
  - OpenAI API key

  5. Missing Setup Steps

  The documentation mentions setup steps but assumes PostgreSQL is already installed:
  cp .env.example .env  # Add your API keys
  alembic upgrade head  # <- This would fail without PostgreSQL

  What's Missing

  1. PostgreSQL Installation: No PostgreSQL server installed
  2. Database Creation: No agentic_system database created
  3. User Setup: No postgres user with password postgres
  4. Service Configuration: No PostgreSQL service running
  5. Environment File: No .env file with actual credentials

  Typical Setup Required



  # 4. Create .env file
  cp .env.example .env

  # 5. Run migrations
  alembic upgrade head



  # Option 1: Reduce log level
  PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn main:app
  --reload --log-level warning

  # Option 2: Disable auto-reload 
  (manual restart needed)
  PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn main:app
  --log-level info

  # Option 3: Current way (keeps 
  all logs)
  python main.py



  ###To GEMINI
   As a tester, you have been asked to follow a test plan and test & provide reports including finding and major issues 
   You have been asked NOT TO FIX or UPDATE our code
   
   The plan is to test/verify our code for @shared/docs/task_management/task_breakdown/P1-S1-BREAKDOWN.md
   Please see the test plan here @test_plans/shared_test_plans/active/backend_v0p1_p1_content_phase1_test_plan.md
   Please ensure you are only test, do not attempt to update or fix our code
   Don't trust and claims that the tests have passed. 




     For the application to work with PostgreSQL, you would need:

  # 1. Install PostgreSQL
  sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

  # 2. Start PostgreSQL service
  sudo systemctl start postgresql
  sudo systemctl enable postgresql

  # 3. Create database and user
  sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE agentic_system;"
  sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';"
  sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE agentic_system TO postgres;"
