# Enhanced Development Approach with Claude Code Sub-Agents

## üéØ Vision
Transform our development workflow by introducing specialized Claude Code sub-agents that work together to deliver higher quality code faster, with better planning, implementation, and testing.

## ü§ñ Proposed Sub-Agent Architecture

### 1. **Planner Agent** (`planner`)
**Purpose**: Research, analyze, and create detailed implementation plans

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze feature requirements and MVP specs
- Research multiple implementation approaches
- Evaluate technology choices and trade-offs
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Break down work into manageable tasks
- Update roadmap and task documentation
- Estimate effort and identify dependencies

**Tools Access**:
- Read (for analyzing existing code)
- WebSearch/WebFetch (for research)
- Grep/Glob (for codebase analysis)
- Task management commands

**System Prompt Focus**:
```
You are a senior technical architect specializing in planning and system design.
Your role is to thoroughly research, analyze, and create detailed implementation plans.
Always consider multiple approaches, evaluate trade-offs, and provide clear recommendations.
Focus on creating actionable, detailed plans that other agents can execute.
```

### 2. **Coder Agent** (`coder`)
**Purpose**: Implement features following TDD approach with clean, modular code

**Responsibilities**:
- Write production-quality code following plans
- Implement features using TDD methodology
- Create modular, maintainable code structures
- Follow project conventions and patterns
- Add descriptive comments to key functions
- Ensure code is properly typed and documented
- Handle error cases and edge conditions

**Tools Access**:
- All file manipulation tools (Read, Write, Edit)
- Bash (for running commands)
- Git operations
- Development commands (devgo, etc.)

**System Prompt Focus**:
```
You are an expert software engineer focused on implementation.
Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implement features.
Create clean, modular code under 1500 lines per file.
Always check for existing functionality before creating new code.
Add descriptive comments to main functions and complex logic.
```

### 3. **Tester Agent** (`tester`)
**Purpose**: Code review, testing, and quality assurance

**Responsibilities**:
- Review code for quality and best practices
- Write comprehensive test cases
- Run test suites and analyze results
- Perform security and vulnerability checks
- Validate performance requirements
- Ensure documentation completeness
- Check for code duplication
- Verify error handling

**Tools Access**:
- Read-only file access
- Bash (for running tests)
- Testing commands (testgo)
- Linting and analysis tools

**System Prompt Focus**:
```
You are a quality assurance expert and code reviewer.
Focus on finding bugs, security issues, and quality problems.
Write comprehensive tests covering edge cases.
Ensure code meets project standards and best practices.
Validate that implementations match specifications.
```

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Standard Development Flow

    A[Feature Request] --> B[Planner Agent]
    B --> C[Technical Spec]
    C --> D[Coder Agent]
    D --> E[Implementation]
    E --> F[Tester Agent]
    F --> G{Pass?}
    G -->|No| D

```

### Week 1 JobDisco Example Flow

1. **Planning Phase** (Planner Agent):
   ```
   @planner Analyze Week 1 requirements for career page monitoring.
   Research web scraping approaches for job boards.
   Create technical specification for FastAPI backend.
   ```

2. **Implementation Phase** (Coder Agent):
   ```
   @coder Implement the Company and Job models following the spec.
   Use TDD approach with pytest.
   ```

3. **Testing Phase** (Tester Agent):
   ```
   @tester Review the implemented models and scraping service.
   Write integration tests for the API endpoints.
   Check for security vulnerabilities in web scraping.
   ```

## üöÄ Enhanced Command System

### New Commands to Support Sub-Agents

#### `/plan` - Invoke Planner Agent
```markdown
Automatically invokes the planner agent to:
1. Analyze current task/feature
2. Research implementation approaches
3. Create detailed technical spec
4. Update task breakdowns
```

#### `/implement` - Invoke Coder Agent
```markdown
Automatically invokes the coder agent to:
1. Read technical spec from planner
2. Implement using TDD approach
3. Create modular, clean code
4. Update progress tracking
```

#### `/review` - Invoke Tester Agent
```markdown
Automatically invokes the tester agent to:
1. Review implemented code
2. Run existing tests
3. Write additional tests
4. Provide quality report
```

#### `/dev-cycle` - Full Development Cycle
```markdown
Orchestrates all three agents:

2. **Test with simple tasks** to refine prompts
3. **Update commands** to support agent invocation
4. **Document patterns** as they emerge
5. **Iterate based on results**

This enhanced approach will transform JobDisco development into a more efficient, higher-quality process with specialized agents handling each phase of development.
