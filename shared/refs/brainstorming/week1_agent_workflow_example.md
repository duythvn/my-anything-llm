# JobDisco Week 1: Agent-Driven Development Example

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Implement career page monitoring system using the new sub-agent workflow.

## ðŸ“… Week 1 Tasks (from ROADMAP.md)
1. Set up FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL
2. Create database models (Company, Job, ScrapeLog)
3. Build web scraping service
4. Create REST API endpoints
5. Set up Next.js frontend
6. Create company management and job listings pages
7. Configure N8N workflow

## ðŸ¤– Agent-Driven Workflow

### Day 1: Planning & Backend Models

#### Morning: Technical Planning
```bash
# Invoke planner for backend architecture
@planner Analyze Week 1 requirements for JobDisco career page monitoring. 
Focus on:
- FastAPI backend structure
- Database schema design for Company, Job, and ScrapeLog models
- Web scraping architecture choices (BeautifulSoup vs Playwright)
- API endpoint design following REST best practices
Create a detailed technical specification.
```

**Expected Output**:
- Technical specification document
- Database schema diagrams
- API endpoint specifications
- Technology decisions with justifications

#### Afternoon: Model Implementation
```bash
# Implement database models using coder
@coder Implement the database models following the technical spec:
- Company model with fields: id, name, career_url, last_checked, active
- Job model with fields: id, company_id, title, url, location, posted_date, description
- ScrapeLog model for tracking scraping history
Use SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL, include Alembic migrations.
Follow TDD approach with pytest.
```

### Day 2: Scraping Service & API

#### Morning: Scraping Service
```bash
# Plan scraping approach
@planner Research and design a robust web scraping service that:
- Handles various career page formats
- Implements retry logic and rate limiting
- Detects Australia/Remote keywords
- Provides good error handling
Compare BeautifulSoup4 vs Playwright approaches.

# Implement scraping service
@coder Implement the web scraping service based on the spec.
Create a modular design with:
- Abstract base scraper class
- Company-specific scrapers if needed
- Keyword detection for Australia/Remote
- Comprehensive error handling
Write tests first using TDD.
```

#### Afternoon: API Endpoints
```bash
# Implement REST API
@coder Create FastAPI endpoints:
- POST /api/companies - Add new company
- GET /api/companies - List all companies  
- GET /api/jobs - Get filtered job listings
- POST /api/scrape/trigger - Manual scrape trigger
Include proper validation, error handling, and OpenAPI documentation.
Use dependency injection for database sessions.
```

### Day 3: Frontend Setup

#### Morning: Frontend Architecture
```bash
# Plan frontend architecture
@planner Design the Next.js frontend architecture for JobDisco:
- Component structure for company management
- State management approach (Context vs Zustand)
- API client design with proper typing
- UI/UX considerations for job listings
Create component hierarchy and data flow diagrams.

# Setup Next.js project
@coder Set up Next.js 14 project with:
- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui components
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Proper project structure
Create base layout and routing.
```

#### Afternoon: Frontend Components
```bash
# Implement company management
@coder Create company management features:
- CompanyList component with data table
- AddCompanyForm with validation
- CompanyCard for individual display
- API integration with error handling
Use TDD with React Testing Library.

# Implement job listings
@coder Create job listings dashboard:
- JobsTable with sorting and filtering
- JobCard component
- Filter controls for location/keywords
- Real-time updates via polling
Include loading states and error handling.
```

### Day 4: Integration & N8N

#### Morning: Integration Testing
```bash
# Full system review
@tester Review the complete Week 1 implementation:
- Test database models and relationships
- Validate scraping service reliability
- Check API endpoint security and performance
- Review frontend components and UX
- Verify error handling throughout
Write integration tests and identify any gaps.

# Fix identified issues
@coder Address issues found in review:
[Issues will be listed by tester]
Ensure all tests pass and coverage meets 80%+ target.
```

#### Afternoon: N8N Workflow
```bash
# Plan N8N integration
@planner Design N8N workflow for daily automation:
- Schedule trigger at 9 AM
- Loop through active companies
- Call backend API for scraping
- Export results to Google Sheets
- Error notification system

# Implement N8N workflow
@coder Create N8N workflow configuration:
- Set up webhook nodes
- Configure authentication
- Implement error handling
- Create Google Sheets integration
Test with sample companies.
```

### Day 5: Final Review & Documentation

#### Morning: Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Final quality check
@tester Perform final review of Week 1 deliverables:
- Run full test suite
- Check test coverage
- Validate against original requirements
- Performance testing with multiple companies
- Security audit of endpoints
Provide final quality report.
```

#### Afternoon: Documentation & Deployment
```bash
# Update documentation
@coder Update project documentation:
- API documentation with examples
- Frontend component storybook
- Deployment instructions
- N8N workflow setup guide
Ensure README is comprehensive.

# Prepare for deployment
@coder Create Docker setup:
- Backend Dockerfile
- Frontend Dockerfile  
- docker-compose.yml for full stack
- Environment variable templates
Test complete stack locally.
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Outcomes

### By End of Week 1
- âœ… Working backend with database models
- âœ… Functional web scraping for 10+ companies
- âœ… REST API with full CRUD operations
- âœ… Frontend dashboard for company/job management
- âœ… Automated N8N workflow running daily
- âœ… 80%+ test coverage
- âœ… Complete documentation

### Time Savings
- **Planning**: 2-3 hours saved with focused planner agent
- **Implementation**: 30% faster with TDD-focused coder
- **Testing**: Automatic review catches issues early
- **Overall**: 40% reduction in development time

## ðŸ”„ Daily Standup Format

```markdown

```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1. **Let agents work independently** - Don't interrupt mid-task
2. **Review between phases** - Check outputs before proceeding
3. **Iterate when needed** - Testerâ†’Coder cycle is normal
4. **Trust the process** - Planning prevents problems
5. **Document decisions** - Agents will reference them

This example shows how the three-agent system can deliver Week 1 of JobDisco efficiently with high quality.
