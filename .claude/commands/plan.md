# /plan

Invoke the planner agent to analyze requirements and create detailed technical specifications.

## Usage

```
/plan [feature description]
```

## What it does

1. Analyzes the specified feature or current task
2. Researches multiple implementation approaches
3. Evaluates technology choices and trade-offs

/plan Create RSS feed monitoring system for company discovery
```

## Process

The planner agent will:
1. Read relevant project documentation (ROADMAP.md, mvp_specs.md)
2. Research best practices and implementation patterns
3. Analyze the existing codebase for reusable components
4. Create a comprehensive technical specification
5. Break down work into manageable tasks with estimates

## Output

The agent provides:
- Technical specification document
- Architecture decisions and justifications
- Task breakdown with time estimates
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Updated project documentation

Use this command at the start of any new feature or when you need a detailed implementation plan.
